                        <p>You have already read about the role of India’s highest Court called the Supreme Court.
                            Just below the Supreme Court, there are High Courts which are the highest courts of law
                            in States. The High Courts are part of the Indian judiciary, and function under the supervision,
                            guidance and control of the Supreme Court. As highest court in the State, a High Court
                            supervises the subordinate courts in the State. The High Courts are mainly courts of
                            appeal. These Courts hear appeals from numerous subordinate courts working at district
                            level. The system of appointment of judges, their qualifications and the working of
                            subordinate courts is under the direct control and supervision of the High Court of the
                            State concerned. In this lesson you will read about the State High Courts. You will also get
                            an idea of subordinate courts, including the District and Session Courts.
                            Objectives
                            <br>After studying this lesson, you will be able to
                            l describe the composition and organisation of the High Courts;
                            l explain the powers and jurisdiction of the High Courts;
                            l appreciate the role of the High Courts as protector of fundamental rights; and
                            l explain the working of the subordinate or lower courts. <br>
                            <span>1.1</span> The State High Courts
                            At present there are 21 High Courts for 28 States and seven Union Territories. The High
                            Courts are the highest courts at State level, but being part of integrated Indian judiciary
                            they work under the superintendence, direction and control of the Supreme Court. <br>
                            <br><span>1.1.1</span> Composition
                            There is a High Court for each State. However, there can be a common High Court for
                            two or more States. For example, the States of Punjab and Haryana and the Union Territory Structure of Government
                            of Chandigarh have a common High Court situated at Chandigarh. Similarly, the High
                            Court of Guwahati is common for seven northeastern States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur,
                            Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh. Delhi, though not a State, has its
                            own separate High Court. Every High Court has a Chief Justice and a number of judges.
                            The number of judges varies from State to State. The number of judges of each High
                            <br>Court is determined by the President.
                            The judges of the High Courts are appointed by the President of India. While appointing
                            Chief Justice of a High Court, the President has to consult the Chief Justice of the Supreme
                            Court and the Governor of the State concerned. While appointing other judges, the President
                            consults the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of the High Court and
                            Governor of the State concerned. The judges can be transferred from one High Court to
                            another by the President. As mentioned earlier, consultation with the Chief Justice of the
                            Supreme Court in respect of appointments and transfers of the judges of the High Court is
                            also obligatory and binding for the President. While the constitutional status of the President
                            remains intact, the actual selection of judges is made by a team of senior judges of the
                            Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of India in accordance with 1993 ruling as
                            reinterpreted in 1999 by the Supreme Court.This is known as Collegium of the Supreme
                            Court. Its recommendations are binding on the President.
                            <br><span>1.1.2</span> Qualifications, Tenure and Removal of the Judges
                            In order to be appointed as a judge of a High Court, the person concerned should possess
                            following qualifications:
                            (i) He or she should be a citizen of India.
                            (ii) He or she should have held a judicial office, at the district level or below for at least
                            ten years.
                            OR
                            He or she should have been an advocate in one or more High Courts for at least ten
                            years continuously without break.
                            Once appointed, the High Court judges hold office till they attain the age of 62 years. After
                            retirement, they may be appointed judges of the Supreme Court or they may practise as
                            advocates either in the Supreme Court or in any High Court other than the High Court in
                            <br>which they served as judges.
                            A High Court judge may be removed before he or she attains the age of 62 years, only on
                            the ground of incapacity or proved misbehaviour. He or she may be removed if both the
                            Houses of Parliament adopt a resolution by a majority of their total membership and by
                            two thirds majority of members present and voting, separately in each House in the same
                            session. Such a resolution is submitted to the President, who then can remove the concerned
                            judge. This procedure is same as for removal of judges of the Supreme Court.
                            <br><span>1.2</span> Powers and Jurisdiction of the High Court
                            The High Courts have the power to hear and decide cases which are brought directly to it.
                            This power is called Original Jurisdiction. When a High Court hears an appeal against the
                            decision of a lower court, it is called Appellate Jurisdiction. A High Court is mostly a court
                            of appeal. Appeals in both civil and criminal cases are brought to it against the decisions of
                            the lower courts.
                            <br><span>1.2.2</span> Original Jurisdiction
                            The original jurisdiction of the High Courts is very limited. Cases of alleged violation of
                            fundamental rights can be started in High Courts, or in the Supreme Court. The High
                            Courts have the power to issue orders to restore the fundamental rights of the people. You
                            will recall that these orders are called writs.
                            Power to Issue Writs: You have read in the ‘Right to Constitutional Remedies’ in the
                            lesson on Fundamental Rights that the Supreme Courts and High Courts can issue writs
                            to ensure that rights of the people are not violated either by State or otherwise. The
                            Constitution has specifically given the power ‘to issue certain writs’ to the High Courts.
                            These Courts can issue writs (which are binding directions of the Court) to any person or
                            authority, including government of the State concerned. The writs in the nature of Habeas,
                            Corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari (explained in lesson 6)
                            for the enforcement of rights of the people. This power is exercised in the original jurisdiction
                            of the High Court, and is not derogatory to similar power of the Supreme Court.
                            A High Court can hear election petition in its original jurisdiction, challenging the election
                            of a Member of Parliament or State Legislative Assembly. It can set aside the election of
                            a member if it finds that he or she used corrupt means in his or her election. All the lower
                            courts function under the superintendence control and guidance of the High Court in the
                            State.
                            <br>High Courts hear appeals against the judgements of the subordinate courts. In civil cases,
                            appellate jurisdiction extends to all such cases which involve an amount exceeding
                            Rs. 5 lakh. Any party to a civil dispute, which is dissatisfied with the decision of the
                            District Court may appeal against the decision of the District Court in the High Court. It Structure of Government
                            also hears cases relating to patents and designs, succession, land acquisition, insolvency
                            and guardianship.
                            <br>The High Courts hear and decide appeals against decisions of the sessions courts in criminal
                            cases. An accused who is found guilty by a sessions court, and awarded a sentence may
                            file an appeal against the verdict of the sessions court. Sometimes even State may appeal
                            against a sessions court judgement for enhancement of punishment. The High Court may
                            accept the decision of the sessions court, or alter it and increase or reduce the sentence, or
                            change the nature of sentence, or may acquit an accused. However, if an accused is
                            awarded death sentence by the sessions court, the sentence must be confirmed by the
                            High Court before the person is hanged to death. Even if the accused does not file an
                            appeal against death sentence, the State refers it to the High Court for confirmation.
                            <br><span>1.2.2</span> Transfer of Cases to the High Court
                            If a High Court is satisfied that a case pending in a subordinate court involves a substantial
                            question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, the High Court may withdraw
                            such a case from the lower court. After examining the case, the High Court may either
                            dispose it off itself, or may return it to the lower court with instructions for disposal of the
                            case.
                            <br><span>1.2.3</span> Superintendence of Subordinate Courts
                            A High Court has the right of superintendence and control over all the subordinate courts
                            in all the matter of judicial and administrative nature. In the exercise of its power of
                            superintendence, the High Court may call for any information from the lower courts; may
                            make and issue general rules and prescribe norms for regulating the practice and
                            proceedings of these courts; and it may issue such directions, from time to time, as it may
                            deem necessary.
                            It can also make rules and regulations relating to the appointment, demotion, promotion
                            and leave of absence for the officers of the subordinate courts.
                            <br><span>1.2.4</span> Court of Record
                            A High Court is also a court of record, like the Supreme Court.Lower courts in a State are
                            bound to follow the decisions of the High Court which are cited as precedents. A High
                            Court has also the power to punish for its contempt or disrespect.

                            In each district of India there are various types of subordinate or lower courts. They are
                            civil courts, criminal courts and revenue courts. These Courts hear civil cases, criminal
                            cases and revenue cases, respectively.
                            Civil cases pertain to disputes between two or more persons regarding property, breach
                            of agreement or contract, divorce or landlord – tenant disputes. Civil Courts settle these
                            disputes. They do not award any punishment as violation of law is not involved in civil
                            cases.
                            Criminal cases relate to violation of laws. These cases involve theft, dacoity, rape, pickpocketing, physical assault, murder, etc. These cases are filed in the lower court by the
                            police, on behalf of the state, againt the accused. In such cases the accused, if found
                            guilty, is awarded punishment like fine, imprisonment or even death sentence.
                            Revenue cases relate to land revenue on agriculture land in the district.
                            <br><span>1.3.1</span> Qualifications and Appointment of Judges
                            The judges of subordinate courts are appointed by the Governor in consultation with the
                            Chief Justice of the High Court of the concerned State. These days, in most of the States
                            judicial service officers including the magistrates are selected through competitive
                            examinations held by the State Public Service Commission. They are finally appointed by
                            the Governor.
                            Any person who has been an advocate for at least seven years or one who is in the Structure of Government
                            service of the State or the Central Government is eligible to be a judge of the District
                            Court provided he/she possess the required legal qualifications.
                            <br><span>1.3.2</span> Civil Courts
                            The Court of the District Judge is the highest civil court in a district to deal with civil cases.
                            Very often the same court is called the Court of District and Sessions Judge, when it deals
                            with both civil and criminal cases at the district level. The judge of this court is appointed
                            by the Governor of the State.
                            Below the Court of District Judge, there may be one or more courts of sub judges in the
                            district. Separate family courts, which are equal to courts of sub judge, have been established
                            in districts to exclusively hear cases of family disputes, like divorce, custody of children,
                            etc. Below them there are courts of munsifs and small causes courts which decide cases
                            involving petty amounts. No appeal can be made against the decisions of the small causes
                            courts. All these courts hear and settle civil disputes.
                            The Court of the District Judge (called the District Courts) hears not only appeals against
                            the decisions of the courts of sub judges, but also some of the cases begin directly in the
                            Court of District Judge itself. Appeals against the decisions of this court may be heard by
                            the High Court of the State.
                            Civil Courts deal with cases pertaining to disputes between two or more persons regarding
                            property, divorce, contract, and breach of agreement or landlord – tenant disputes.
                            <br><span>1.3.3</span> Criminal Courts
                            The Court of the Sessions Judge (known as Sessions Courts) is the highest court for
                            criminal cases in a district. Below this court, there are courts of magistrates of First,
                            Second and Third class. In metropolitan cities like Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai,
                            First Class Magistrates are called Metropolitan Magistrates. All these criminal courts are
                            competent to try the accused and to award punishment, as sanctioned by law, to those
                            who are found guilty of violation of law.
                            Criminal Courts hear criminal cases which are related to violation of laws. These cases
                            involve theft, dacoity, rape, arson, pick-pocketing, physical assault, murder etc. In such
                            involve theft, dacoity, rape, arson, pick-pocketing, physical assault, murder etc. In such
                            cases the guilty person is awarded punishment. It may be fine, imprisonment or even
                            death sentence.
                            <br>Normally every accused is presented by the police before a magistrate. The magistrate
                            can finally dispose off cases of minor crime. But, when a magistrate finds prima-facie
                            case of serious crime he/she may commit the accused to the sessions court. Thus, sessions
                            courts try the accused who are sent upto them by the magistrate concerned.
                            As mentioned above, an accused who is awarded death sentence by the sessions court,
                            can be hanged to death only after his sentence is confirmed by the High Court.
                            <br><span>1.3.4</span> Revenue Courts
                            Revenue courts deal with cases of land revenue in the State. The highest revenue court in
                            the district is the Board of Revenue. Under it are the Courts of Commissioners, Collectors,
                            Tehsildars and Assistant Tehsildars. The Board of Revenue hears the final appeals against
                            all the lower revenue courts under it.
